# AIMLModule11
## Introduction:

The goal of this analysis was to predict the price of used cars based on various features available in the dataset. The dataset contains features such as year, mileage, and other relevant characteristics of the cars. Our primary focus was to evaluate how different factors impact the price of used cars and assess the performance of linear and ridge regression models in predicting car prices.

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing:

**#Data Exploration:**
Analyze Missing Values:
We identified missing values in the odometer column, which were replaced by the mean odometer reading for each car year. We also checked for other missing values across the dataset and dropped irrelevant columns (id, VIN, size) that contained excessive missing data or were non-predictive.
Converted Columns to Appropriate Types: Convert object etc types to appropriate type
Check for Outliers:
To detect outliers, we visualized key features (price, odometer, year) using box plots. Outliers were identified as values that fell outside the typical range, such as unusually high prices or mileage. Q1-1.5 IQR --- Q3+1.5 IQR was applied on price column to exclude outliers. 
These preprocessing steps ensured the dataset was clean, with missing values and outliers appropriately handled, making it ready for model building.

Feature Engineering and Encoding:
Categorical Encoding: We used One-Hot Encoding and James-Stein encoding to encode categorical values to numerical columns. Ordinal fields like conditions, cylinders were encoded with 1,2,3,4. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

# Trends and Relationships:
We observed a positive correlation between the year and price: As the year of a car increases, so does its price. This suggests that newer cars generally have a higher value compared to older cars.
We also noticed a negative correlation between mileage and price: As the mileage (or odometer reading) increases, the price of the car tends to decrease. This aligns with the intuition that cars with more miles driven are generally worth less.
Other variables such as the car make, model, and features also showed relationships with price, but these were handled using encoders.
Visualizing Trends:
Scatter plots and correlation matrices were used to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (price). The visualizations confirmed the observed trends: a decrease in price with higher mileage and an increase in price with newer cars.
Model Building:

# We created two models to predict the price of used cars:

Linear Regression:
A linear regression model was created to predict car prices using all the features. The linear regression algorithm assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target price.
The model was trained and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure a robust assessment.
Ridge Regression:
To address potential multicollinearity issues (where features might be correlated with each other), we used Ridge Regression. This model applies L2 regularization to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients of correlated features.
We performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal value of alpha, which controls the strength of the regularization.
Model Evaluation:

The models were evaluated using various metrics, including the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). Here's a summary of the performance evaluation:

Linear Regression Model:
MSE (Mean Squared Error): The MSE was calculated to measure the average squared difference between the observed actual outcomes and the model's predictions.
R² (R-squared): The R² score tells us how well the model explains the variance in the data. A higher R² value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
Ridge Regression Model:
MSE and R²: After tuning the alpha hyperparameter using GridSearchCV, the Ridge regression model performed similarly to the linear regression model but with a slightly better ability to generalize to unseen data due to the regularization effect.
The optimal value of alpha was found to be around 10, indicating a good balance between fitting the data and controlling overfitting.
Key Insights:

# Impact of year and mileage on Price:
As expected, cars that are newer (year increases) tend to have higher prices. Conversely, as the mileage increases, the price of the car decreases. These findings were confirmed by both the linear regression and ridge regression models.
The relationship between mileage and price was negative, which is logical because higher mileage typically indicates more wear and tear on the car.
Model Comparison:
Both the linear regression and ridge regression models showed comparable performance on the dataset. However, Ridge regression outperformed linear regression slightly in terms of generalization to unseen data, likely due to its regularization mechanism that helps prevent overfitting.
The regularization effect of Ridge regression ensures that the model doesn't overemphasize any particular feature, making it a more robust model when dealing with potentially correlated features in the data.
Interpretability:
Both models are interpretable, with the coefficients from the linear regression model indicating the influence of each feature on the car price. For example, the coefficient for year was positive, and the coefficient for mileage was negative, consistent with the trends we observed during EDA.
Conclusion:

# Based on the analysis and model evaluations, the following conclusions can be drawn:

The relationship between year and price, as well as between mileage and price, is consistent with real-world intuition and is well captured by both the linear and ridge regression models.
While both models performed well, the Ridge regression model provided slightly better results due to its regularization, making it more robust for this dataset.
Future improvements could involve exploring additional features (e.g., car make, model, engine type) and experimenting with other regression models, such as Lasso or ElasticNet, which might offer further enhancements in predictive performance.
Recommendations for Further Analysis:

Feature Expansion: Incorporating additional features such as the car make, model, fuel type, and condition of the vehicle could improve the predictive power of the models.
Model Refinement: Experimenting with more advanced machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), could provide a more complex and potentially higher-performing model.
Outlier Detection: Further analysis on outliers in car prices and mileage could help improve model accuracy, as extreme values could skew predictions.
This evaluation provides a solid foundation for understanding the trends in used car prices and outlines potential areas for further improvement in predictive modeling.
